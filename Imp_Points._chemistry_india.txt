Today's task : 
	http://w3init.com/php/libraries/generate-pdf-from-html-code-in-php-using-mpdf/
	https://mpdf.github.io/getting-started/creating-your-first-file.html


	Add on blur on text boxes on table and see that they are also refreshed.	




Things I need to check:
	Check the error page when server is down.
	There is a problem in dropdown as they are not storing the value that has been presses and are instead returning to default values.
	Also see that same companies are not selected in the dropdown.
	Unset the session variables once the user exits the page.
	Also check if the user has pressed select product first then no useless sessions are not set.
	Currently the values of division cust name and date is stored when select product button is pressed.
	Add a working search panel in supplier and product.
	In the pdf in the COA section check whether if text is written then only it should be visible and if file is only there then PFA should come and accordingly.
	
	
	
Things that I have done:

When a dropdown is selected the AJAX is triggered on ONCHANGE EVENT  and i also store the id of the company in session variable.
whenever a page is refreshed then iamges are brought back by session variables.

Also whenver the select product or select supplier button is selected than event is triggered which stores values of text boxes and all the dropdown that are selected.




Test Cases :
All the values preserved when page in refreshed.
Whenever select button or any other button is pressed on the page all the values are preserved.
